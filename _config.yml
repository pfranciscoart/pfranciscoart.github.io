resume_header_intro: "<p>Peter Francisco is a Filipino-born artist living and working in Adelaide, South Australia. Working across watercolour, oils, and acrylics, Francisco explores memory, identity, and the emotional weight of nostalgia. His art is grounded in the textures of everyday Filipino life. Food, objects, and familiar scenes from home often become anchors for deeper reflection. His detailed, technically precise paintings revisit childhood recollections and the small rituals that shaped him. These works carry an undercurrent of longing shaped by migration and the loss of his mother, whose influence remains a steady presence in his creative life. Francisco often weaves playful or symbolic elements into his compositions, drawing from cultural motifs, family traditions, and the objects he has carried with him across countries. These items serve as quiet avatars for personal history. Much like a cabinet of curiosities, his arrangements become a form of storytelling. They offer a way to understand the world and describe his identity through careful gathering and display. His exhibitions invite slow looking. The paintings are rich with coded memories and emotional cues that reward contemplation. Francisco\’s personal symbology is both intimate and generous, encouraging viewers to reflect on their own ties to home, belonging, and the fleeting nature of life. The pleasure lies in turning the work over in your mind and tracing the threads that bind one memory to the next.</p>"
